- Containrized front-end and back-end 
- created Dockerfiles
- created docker-compose.yml
- Cloned the repo and deployed the application on my local machine. Got into some challenges with CORS and front-end backend communincations but managed to get it working at the end.
- Tried to configure external network on my local deployment but learnt that it is not possible on MACOS.

- Created the corresponding frontend page for notifications
- created local dynamodb container and tested it
- Created postgres container and installed psql into gitpod environment and tested connectivtiy.

# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- Containrized front-end and back-end 
- created Dockerfiles
- created docker-compose.yml
- Cloned the repo and deployed the application on my local machine. Got into some challenges with CORS and front-end backend communincations but managed to get it working at the end.
